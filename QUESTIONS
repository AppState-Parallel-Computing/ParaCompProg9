You should get your code working before answering these questions.
Make sure your code is compiled with the cuda flags that enable optimizations.

1) If you run the knapsack program with a relatively small number of
objects and capacity, you'll see that the GPU
version (both the optimized and the naive) is slower than the CPU version.
Why?


2) Run the naive knapsack several times with -c 14 and -n -14 and try
out various block size (128, 256, 512, 1024).
What trend do you see in the reported speedups?  Explain why that trend
occurs.


3) Explain why this implementation is limited to one block.
Hint: the answer has to do with synchronization.



4) Compare the following two configurations using the optimized kernel:
-c 20 -n 9
-c 9 -n 20
Why is the speedup so much higher for the first configuration (-c 20 -n 9)?
